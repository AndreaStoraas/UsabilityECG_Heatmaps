# Source code: Usability of heatmaps for ECG analysis

This repository provides the source code for replicating the experiments described in "Usability of Heatmaps for Explaining a Deep Neural Network for Electrocardiogram (ECG) Analysis: A Case Study"
The ECG dataset is available on Physionet.
For the pretrained weights of the Pulse2Pulse discriminator, please contact Vajira Thambawita or the corresponding author (andrea@simula.no).
